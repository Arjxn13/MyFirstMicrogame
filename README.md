Project Title: "My First Microgame" 

Description: My game features a player going around hostile enemy robots. It includes a boss battle at the end, slick graphics and immersive movement mechanics. 
After completing the tutorial, I modified the game by adding more enemies, changing the movement, adding an extra area, watermelon and a reload recharge mechanic. 

Setup Instructions: Download game file and run on Unity. 

Reflection: During the process of making this game I learned how to work with and manage Unity effectively.
I figured out the Unity asset shop importing various code and in game assets which allowed my game to become more in depth and immersive with extra features. 
Along with this, I cleaned up my Unity portfolio making things more clean and seamless, as when I was starting out it felt overwhelming.
Overall it was a fun and worthwhile experience that allowed me to create and execute the vision I had of my game to a tea.
